## Cybersecurity Workforce

There is a major global shortage of cybersecurity professionals. Demand far exceeds supply.

---

## Thinking Like an Attacker

Security professionals must understand how attackers think.

Types of hackers:

- **Black hats** – malicious attackers  
- **White hats** – ethical security professionals  
- **Grey hats** – operate in between

## The CIA Triad

Foundational security model:

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Confidentiality** | Only authorized people can access data |
| **Integrity** | Data is accurate and untampered |
| **Availability** | Systems and data are accessible when needed |

---

## What is Penetration Testing?

Simulating what a cybercriminal would do to your organization.

Purpose:

- Identify vulnerabilities before attackers do  
- Test defenses realistically  

Common causes of vulnerabilities:

- Design flaws  
- Unsecured networks  
- Poor configurations  
- Complex systems  
- Human error  

---

## Phases of Penetration Testing

1. **Reconnaissance** – gather information  
2. **Scanning** – identify vulnerabilities  
3. **Exploitation** – attempt compromise  
4. **Risk Analysis & Recommendations**  
5. **Reporting**

---

### Reconnaissance
- Collect IPs, domains, network info  
- Define scope and goals  
- Most time is spent here

### Scanning
- Port scanners  
- Vulnerability scanners  
- Static vs dynamic web testing

### Exploitation
- Attempt system compromise  
- Privilege escalation  
- Data access  
- DoS testing

### Risk Analysis
- Evaluate vulnerabilities  
- Determine risk levels  
- Provide recommendations

### Reporting
Final report includes:

- Vulnerabilities found  
- Risk levels  
- Executive summary  
- Remediation suggestions  

---

## Types of Pen Testing

- **External** – attacker outside network  
- **Internal** – attacker inside network  
- **Targeted** – org + pentesters collaborate  
- **Blind** – tester has minimal info  
- **Double-blind** – org unaware test is happening  

---

## Common Pentesting Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Nmap** | Port scanning & network mapping |
| **Nessus** | Vulnerability scanning |
| **Metasploit** | Exploitation framework |
| **Wireshark** | Network packet analysis |
| Others | John the Ripper, Burp Suite, etc. |

## Know Thy Enemy

Threat actors include:

- Hacktivists  
- Script kiddies  
- Ransomware groups  
- Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)  
- Insiders  

---

## Zero-Day Vulnerabilities

- Unknown flaws with no patch  
- No system is perfectly secure  

---

## Common Attack Vectors

- Social engineering  
- Brute force attacks  
- Software exploits  
- Device theft  
- Privileged misuse  
- Denial of Service  

---

## Modern Network Defenses

- Intrusion Detection/Prevention (IDS/IPS)  
- Firewalls  
- Proxies  
- Network malware prevention  

### Endpoint Defenses

- Antivirus  
- Application whitelisting  
- Sandboxing  
- Patch management  
- Vulnerability management  

---

## Cyber Warfare

Examples of cyberattacks with physical consequences:

- **Stuxnet**  
- **NotPetya**

Cyberspace is considered the **fifth domain of warfare**.

---

## “Everything Security”

As everyday objects become connected computers, security applies to everything.

---

## Value of Cyber Analytics

- Prevent business disruption  
- Guide decision-making  
- Align cybersecurity with mission  
- Understand risk  
- Attribution  
- Safeguard lives  

---

## What Makes a Good Infosec Professional?

- Security is a **team sport**  
- **80% communication & process**, 20% technology  
- Stay updated on trends  
- Healthy paranoia  

---

## Recommended Security Resources

- Schneier on Security  
- Krebs on Security  
- CrowdStrike Blog  
- Dark Reading  
- Daniel Miessler  
- Troy Hunt  
- CSO Online
